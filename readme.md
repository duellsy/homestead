# Laravel Homestead

The official Laravel local development environment.

Official documentation [is located here](http://laravel.com/docs/homestead?version=4.2).

## My additions

This is for my personal dev machine(s), it adds support for:

* XCode debugging
* Mailcatcher installed
* Livereload port opened
* Beanstalkd auto setup (with same name as database for simplicity)

See the Homestead.yaml.tmp file for an example setup, simply create a new Homestead.yaml file using this as your base.
